# General Concepts
- **Backlog**: A dynamically changing collection of pending tasks that are sorted by priority.
- **Sprint Backlog**: A backlog where all tasks are planned to be done inside of a specific sprint.
- **Timebox**: A timebox is a previously agreed period of time during which a person or a team works steadily towards completion of some goal.
- **Defined Process Control**: Following a pre-defined process in a linear fashion to accomplish some goal. (Analyze, plan, execute, waterfall methodology is a real world example)
- **Empirical Process Control**: A more fluid, adaptable process for solving problems by which experience informs us on what to do next.

#### Types of problems
- Simple (High certainty with business/technological requirements)
- Complicated (Medium certainty with business/technological requirements)
- Complex (Low certainty with business/technological requirements)

**Workflow for complex problems**: Plan, do, check, adapt. (PDCA)

*Requirements for PDCA- **'Empirical Process Control'***:
- Transparency: Who is doing what, what is blocking us? Are we able to even see what is going on in our environment?
- Inspection: Are we able to analyze the different components/problems of our systems and extract useful information from them?
- Adaptation: Course correction, changing approach as needed. Are we able to change our approach as our requirements change?

# AGILE 


#### What is AGILE?

Process, people, product.

Using **empirical process control** in a cyclic, iterative fashion to turn ideas into deliverables.

Product centric- not *project* centric.

- **Process** - Iterative, cyclical, **empirical process control**.
- **People** - Self organizing.
- **Product** - Turning an idea into a usable end product.

#### Why AGILE?
- The market has begun requiring more highly complex systems, which AGILE is built to handle.
- We want to generate value more efficiently.
- We want to define business and technological requirements with a high level of certainty.
- Maintain the ability to efficiently change requirements as needed.

# AGILE Roles

#### Scrum Master Role
- To lead effectively, it's a good idea to communicate with your team directly about how they best work and design your process around that.

# Agile Workflow

#### Sprint Planning
- Answer as many open questions/uncertainties as possible when building requirements.

- First sprint planning is going to be inaccurate- overtime estimations will get better as we set precedents and gain an idea of how long certain types of tasks will take.

- Set definitions for the different columns in a sprint board. "Done" may be up to interpretation, for example, and the team needs to specify criteria for when a task/ticket gets moved into a column.
